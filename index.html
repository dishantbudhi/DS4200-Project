            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Our project explores how screen time affects mental health across different demographics and environments. Prior research highlights strong links between high screen exposure and anxiety or depression symptoms in adolescents, so our goal was to examine these patterns in a real dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
                We used a Kaggle dataset with 2,001 participants and 25 attributes, including screen time, social media use, sleep quality, mental health scores, gender, and location.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our key tasks were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify demographic patterns in screen time and mental health.</li>
                <li>Analyze behavioral relationships such as screen time vs. sleep or depression.</li>
                <li>Compare mental health outcomes across environments (urban, suburban, rural).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

                    All gender groups center around 6 hours of screen time, but females show more upper-end outliers—indicating slightly wider variability.

                    There is no strong linear relationship—sleep duration varies widely across all screen-time levels. However, lower sleep quality appears slightly more common among heavier screen users.

                    Higher social media usage generally corresponds with higher depression scores, especially among urban participants. This supports prior research showing that high-intensity digital environments can contribute to anxiety and mood disturbances.

                    The highest concentration of participants falls between 4–8 hours of screen time and moderate mental health scores. Nothing in the heatmap suggests that extreme screen time directly predicts very low or very high mental health scores—indicating a more complex relationship.

                <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall mental health scores are fairly consistent, ranging from about 49 to 51 across all regions and genders. There is a slight dip in the urban male group, but the differences are small—suggesting location alone doesn't strongly determine mental well-being.

            <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
            <h3>What We Learned — Project Conclusions</h3>
            <p>
                Across our five visualizations, several patterns emerged:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Screen time is relatively similar across genders.</li>
                <li>Social media usage has a stronger relationship to depression scores than general screen time.</li>
                <li>Sleep duration is highly varied, and while screen time may influence sleep quality slightly, the effect is not large.</li>
                <li>Environmental differences exist but are subtle, with urban groups showing slightly higher depression indicators.</li>
                <li>Most participants fall into moderate mental-health ranges, even at higher screen-time levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We also learned how important it is to match visualization type to the structure of the data—boxplots for distribution, scatterplots for continuous relationships, heatmaps for density, and interactive category charts for comparison.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, screen time does play a role in mental health, but it's one factor among many. Social media behavior, sleep quality, and environment all contribute to the bigger picture.
            </p>
            <h3>Future Directions</h3>
            <p>
                Future research could incorporate longitudinal tracking, device-specific usage, or predictive modeling.
