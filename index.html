            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Our project explores how screen time affects mental health across different demographics and environments. Prior research highlights strong links between high screen exposure and anxiety or depression symptoms in adolescents, so our goal was to examine these patterns in a real dataset.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                We used a Kaggle dataset with 2,001 participants and 25 attributes, including screen time, social media use, sleep quality, mental health scores, gender, and location.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our key tasks were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify demographic patterns in screen time and mental health.</li>
                <li>Analyze behavioral relationships such as screen time vs. sleep or depression.</li>
                <li>Compare mental health outcomes across environments (urban, suburban, rural).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="data-intro">
            <h2>About the Data</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Our dataset contains <strong>2,001 participants</strong> with <strong>25 attributes</strong>, sourced from Kaggle. 
                The data includes screen time, social media use, sleep quality, mental health scores, gender, and location. 
                The dataset provides a comprehensive view of how digital habits intersect with mental well-being.

                <p>
                    All gender groups center around 6 hours of screen time, but females show more upper-end outliers—indicating slightly wider variability.

                <p>
                    There is no strong linear relationship—sleep duration varies widely across all screen-time levels. However, lower sleep quality appears slightly more common among heavier screen users.

                <p>
                    Higher social media usage corresponds with higher depression scores across all locations, with urban participants showing the most pronounced increases. Error bars indicate variability within groups, showing consistent trends despite individual differences.

                    The highest concentration of participants falls between 4–8 hours of screen time and moderate mental health scores. The heatmap suggests that extreme screen time does not directly predict very low or very high mental health scores—indicating a more complex relationship.

                <p>
                    Overall mental health scores are fairly consistent, ranging from about 49 to 51 across all regions and genders. There is a slight dip in the urban male group, but the differences are small—suggesting location alone doesn't strongly determine mental well-being.

            <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
            <h3>What We Learned — Project Conclusions</h3>
            <p>
                Across our five visualizations, several patterns emerged:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Screen time is relatively similar across genders.</li>
                <li>Social media usage has a stronger relationship to depression scores than general screen time.</li>
                <li>Sleep duration is highly varied, and while screen time may influence sleep quality slightly, the effect is not large.</li>
                <li>Environmental differences exist but are subtle, with urban groups showing slightly higher depression indicators.</li>
                <li>Most participants fall into moderate mental-health ranges, even at higher screen-time levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We also learned how important it is to match visualization type to the structure of the data—boxplots for distribution, scatterplots for continuous relationships, heatmaps for density, and interactive category charts for comparison.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, screen time does play a role in mental health, but it's one factor among many. Social media behavior, sleep quality, and environment all contribute to the bigger picture.
            </p>
            <h3>Actionable Conclusions and Recommendations</h3>
            <p>
                Based on our analysis, we propose the following actionable conclusions and recommendations:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prioritize social media intervention over general screen time limits:</strong> Our data shows that social media usage has a stronger correlation with depression scores than total screen time. Public health campaigns and educational programs should focus specifically on mindful social media consumption rather than blanket screen time restrictions. This includes promoting digital literacy, encouraging breaks from social platforms, and teaching users to recognize when social media use negatively impacts their mood.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Develop location-specific mental health support programs:</strong> While differences are subtle, urban participants show more pronounced increases in depression scores at higher social media usage levels. Urban areas should consider targeted mental health resources that address the unique pressures of high-intensity digital environments. This could include community programs, school-based interventions, and accessible mental health services tailored to urban populations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Emphasize sleep quality over duration in digital wellness guidelines:</strong> Our analysis reveals that sleep duration varies widely regardless of screen time, but sleep quality appears more affected by heavy screen use. Health recommendations should shift focus from simply tracking hours of sleep to promoting better sleep hygiene practices, such as establishing device-free zones before bedtime and reducing blue light exposure in the evening hours.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Future Directions</h3>
            <p>
                Future research could incorporate longitudinal tracking to understand causal relationships, device-specific usage patterns to identify which technologies most impact mental health, and predictive modeling to identify at-risk individuals early. Additionally, qualitative research could explore the mechanisms behind these relationships—understanding not just that social media correlates with depression, but why and how individuals experience these effects differently.
