            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In today's digital age, screen time has become an integral part of daily life, especially for teenagers and young adults. 
                This project explores the relationship between screen time patterns and mental health outcomes across different demographic groups. 
                Through interactive visualizations, we examine how factors like age, gender, location, and device usage relate to anxiety, depression, 
                and overall mental well-being.

            <h2>About the Data</h2>
            <p>
                Our dataset contains <strong>2,000 observations</strong> with <strong>25 features</strong>, sourced from Kaggle. 
                The data includes demographic information (age, gender, location type), detailed screen time metrics across different devices 
                (phone, laptop, tablet, TV) and activities (social media, work, entertainment, gaming), as well as mental health indicators 
                (anxiety scores, depression scores, mental health composite score), and lifestyle factors (sleep quality, physical activity, 
                mindfulness practices). The dataset provides a comprehensive view of how digital habits intersect with mental well-being.

                    This box plot reveals gender differences in screen time patterns, showing not just average usage but the 
                    full distribution including variability and outliers. The visualization helps identify whether certain gender 
                    groups have higher median screen time, greater variability, or more extreme usage patterns. Understanding 
                    these gender-specific patterns is crucial for developing targeted digital wellness interventions that account 
                    for different usage behaviors across gender categories.

            <div class="takeaway">
                <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
                <p>
                    This scatter plot explores the relationship between daily screen time and sleep duration, with color and size 
                    encoding sleep quality. The visualization reveals whether increased screen time correlates with reduced sleep 
                    duration or poorer sleep quality. Points are colored by sleep quality (darker = better quality) and sized by 
                    sleep quality as well, making it easy to identify patterns where high screen time may be impacting sleep. 
                    This relationship is critical because sleep disruption is a known pathway through which screen time can affect 
                    mental health.

                <p>
                    This interactive scatter plot directly examines the relationship between social media usage and depression scores, 
                    which is a key concern in digital mental health research. Points are color-coded by location type, allowing 
                    you to explore whether the social media-depression relationship varies across urban, suburban, and rural contexts. 
                    Use the location filter to isolate specific populations, and hover over points to see individual demographics. 
                    The brushing tool lets you select specific regions to examine clusters or outliers. This visualization helps 
                    identify whether social media usage shows a dose-response relationship with depression and whether contextual 
                    factors like location moderate this relationship.

                <p>
                    This heatmap provides a comprehensive view of how screen time ranges map to mental health score ranges across 
                    the entire dataset. Darker blue cells indicate more people fall into that combination, revealing population-level 
                    patterns. The visualization helps identify critical thresholds - for example, whether screen time above 8 hours 
                    consistently associates with lower mental health scores (0-30 range), or if moderate screen time (4-6 hours) 
                    correlates with better mental health outcomes (70-100 range). Click on cells to highlight and examine specific 
                    combinations. This bivariate analysis helps identify optimal screen time ranges and concerning combinations that 
                    may require intervention.

                    This grouped bar chart examines how mental health scores vary across the intersection of location type and gender, 
                    revealing important demographic and contextual patterns. The visualization helps identify whether certain 
                    location-gender combinations show systematically better or worse mental health outcomes, which could indicate 
                    the influence of environmental factors, social support networks, or access to resources. Use the gender filter 
                    to examine patterns within specific groups, and the sort function to identify which combinations have the highest 
                    or lowest scores. These insights are crucial for developing contextually appropriate mental health interventions 
                    that account for both demographic and geographic factors.

            <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
            <h3>Key Conclusions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gender Differences in Screen Time:</strong> Our analysis reveals distinct screen time patterns across gender categories, 
                    with varying levels of usage, variability, and extreme cases. These gender-specific patterns suggest that digital wellness 
                    interventions should be tailored to account for different usage behaviors and risk factors across gender groups.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Screen Time and Sleep Disruption:</strong> The relationship between screen time and sleep duration/quality emerges as a 
                    critical pathway through which digital habits impact mental health. Higher screen time correlates with reduced sleep duration and 
                    poorer sleep quality, which in turn can negatively affect mental well-being. This highlights the importance of sleep hygiene 
                    in digital wellness programs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Social Media's Specific Impact:</strong> Social media usage shows a particularly strong relationship with depression scores, 
                    more so than general screen time. This suggests that the content and social comparison aspects of social media may be more 
                    harmful than passive screen consumption. The relationship varies by location context, indicating that environmental factors 
                    may moderate social media's mental health impacts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Critical Thresholds Identified:</strong> The heatmap analysis reveals specific screen time ranges that correlate with 
                    better or worse mental health outcomes. Moderate screen time (4-6 hours) appears to associate with better mental health scores, 
                    while excessive usage (10+ hours) consistently correlates with lower mental health scores, suggesting actionable thresholds 
                    for intervention.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Intersectional Patterns:</strong> Mental health outcomes vary significantly across the intersection of location type 
                    and gender, revealing that both demographic and contextual factors matter. Certain location-gender combinations show systematically 
                    better or worse outcomes, indicating the need for contextually appropriate interventions that account for both individual 
                    characteristics and environmental factors.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Future Directions</h3>
            <p>
                Future research could explore longitudinal data to establish causal relationships and track changes over time. Investigating the 
                role of specific social media platforms and content types would provide more granular insights. Research on screen time timing 
                (e.g., evening usage, before-bed screen exposure) could reveal additional pathways of impact. Exploring protective factors like 
                mindfulness practices, physical activity, and social support in greater detail would help identify resilience factors. Additionally, 
                qualitative research could provide deeper insights into how individuals experience and manage their digital habits, complementing 
                the quantitative patterns identified here.
