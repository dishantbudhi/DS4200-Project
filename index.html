            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Our project explores how screen time affects mental health across different demographics and environments. Prior research highlights strong links between high screen exposure and anxiety or depression symptoms in adolescents, so our goal was to examine these patterns in a real dataset.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                We used a Kaggle dataset with 2,001 participants and 25 attributes, including screen time, social media use, sleep quality, mental health scores, gender, and location.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our key tasks were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify demographic patterns in screen time and mental health.</li>
                <li>Analyze behavioral relationships such as screen time vs. sleep or depression.</li>
                <li>Compare mental health outcomes across environments (urban, suburban, rural).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="data-intro">
            <h2>About the Data</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Our dataset contains <strong>2,001 participants</strong> with <strong>25 attributes</strong>, sourced from Kaggle. 
                The data includes screen time, social media use, sleep quality, mental health scores, gender, and location. 
                The dataset provides a comprehensive view of how digital habits intersect with mental well-being.

            <p class="chart-subtitle">Distribution of daily screen time hours across gender groups</p>
            <p class="narrative-link">
                We begin by examining the foundational question: do screen time patterns differ meaningfully across gender groups? This distribution analysis sets the stage for understanding how digital habits vary across demographics.
            </p>
            <div id="vis1" class="chart-container"></div>
            <div class="interpretive-caption">
                <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> While all gender groups cluster around 6 hours of daily screen time, females exhibit more upper-end outliers—revealing that while median usage is similar, some female participants report significantly higher screen exposure. This suggests that gender alone doesn't predict screen time, but individual variation is more pronounced among females.</p>

            <p class="narrative-link">
                Having established baseline screen time patterns, we now explore how digital habits intersect with sleep—a critical component of mental well-being. This analysis reveals whether screen time directly impacts sleep duration or quality.

            <div class="interpretive-caption">
                <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Sleep duration shows wide variation regardless of screen time levels, indicating that screen exposure doesn't strongly predict how long people sleep. However, points with lower sleep quality (darker purple/yellow) cluster more frequently among higher screen-time users—suggesting that while screen time may not reduce sleep hours, it appears to degrade sleep quality, which could contribute to mental health challenges. The color gradient (purple to yellow) represents sleep quality from low (0) to high (10), making it easy to spot patterns.</p>

            <p class="narrative-link">
                While general screen time shows limited impact on sleep, we now investigate a more specific digital behavior: social media usage. This visualization examines how social media consumption relates to depression scores across different environments, revealing whether location amplifies or mitigates these effects.

                <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Depression scores consistently rise as social media usage increases across all location types, demonstrating a clear dose-response relationship. Urban participants show the steepest increases—with depression scores climbing from approximately 8-10 at low usage (0-2 hrs) to 15-18 at high usage (4-6 hrs). This spatial clustering suggests that urban environments may amplify the negative mental health impacts of social media, possibly due to increased social comparison pressures or digital saturation. Error bars show substantial variability within groups, indicating that while the trend is clear, individual responses vary significantly.</p>

Critically, very high screen time (10+ hours) doesn't strongly predict very low mental health scores—suggesting that while excessive screen time may contribute to mental health challenges, it's not determinative. The relationship appears more nuanced than a simple linear correlation, with individual factors likely playing significant roles.</p>

                Our final visualization synthesizes the demographic and environmental factors we've explored. By examining mental health scores across the intersection of location and gender, we can assess whether these demographic characteristics meaningfully predict mental well-being outcomes.

                <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Mental health scores cluster tightly between 49-51 across nearly all location-gender combinations, demonstrating remarkable stability. The only notable deviation is urban males, who show a slight dip to approximately 48—aligning with our earlier finding that urban environments amplify negative mental health impacts. However, the overall consistency suggests that neither location nor gender alone strongly determines mental health outcomes. This reinforces that digital behaviors (like social media usage) may be more predictive than demographic characteristics, pointing to modifiable risk factors rather than fixed demographic destinies.</p>

            <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
            <h3>What We Learned — Project Conclusions</h3>
            <p>
                Across our five visualizations, several patterns emerged:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Screen time is relatively similar across genders.</li>
                <li>Social media usage has a stronger relationship to depression scores than general screen time.</li>
                <li>Sleep duration is highly varied, and while screen time may influence sleep quality slightly, the effect is not large.</li>
                <li>Environmental differences exist but are subtle, with urban groups showing slightly higher depression indicators.</li>
                <li>Most participants fall into moderate mental-health ranges, even at higher screen-time levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We also learned how important it is to match visualization type to the structure of the data—boxplots for distribution, scatterplots for continuous relationships, heatmaps for density, and interactive category charts for comparison.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, screen time does play a role in mental health, but it's one factor among many. Social media behavior, sleep quality, and environment all contribute to the bigger picture.
            </p>
            <h3>Actionable Conclusions and Recommendations</h3>
            <p>
                Based on our analysis, we propose the following actionable conclusions and recommendations:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prioritize social media intervention over general screen time limits:</strong> Our data shows that social media usage has a stronger correlation with depression scores than total screen time. Public health campaigns and educational programs should focus specifically on mindful social media consumption rather than blanket screen time restrictions. This includes promoting digital literacy, encouraging breaks from social platforms, and teaching users to recognize when social media use negatively impacts their mood.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Develop location-specific mental health support programs:</strong> While differences are subtle, urban participants show more pronounced increases in depression scores at higher social media usage levels. Urban areas should consider targeted mental health resources that address the unique pressures of high-intensity digital environments. This could include community programs, school-based interventions, and accessible mental health services tailored to urban populations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Emphasize sleep quality over duration in digital wellness guidelines:</strong> Our analysis reveals that sleep duration varies widely regardless of screen time, but sleep quality appears more affected by heavy screen use. Health recommendations should shift focus from simply tracking hours of sleep to promoting better sleep hygiene practices, such as establishing device-free zones before bedtime and reducing blue light exposure in the evening hours.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Future Directions</h3>
            <p>
                Future research could incorporate longitudinal tracking to understand causal relationships, device-specific usage patterns to identify which technologies most impact mental health, and predictive modeling to identify at-risk individuals early. Additionally, qualitative research could explore the mechanisms behind these relationships—understanding not just that social media correlates with depression, but why and how individuals experience these effects differently.
