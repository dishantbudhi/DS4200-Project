DESIGN EXPLANATION: THE IMPACT OF SCREEN TIME ON MENTAL HEALTH

Published Website: https://dishantbudhi.com/DS4200-Project/

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project explores relationships between screen time patterns and mental health outcomes using Altair and D3.js visualizations. Dataset: "Impact of Screen Time on Mental Health" from Kaggle (2,001 participants, 25 attributes).

VISUALIZATIONS

1. Boxplot - Screen Time by Gender (Altair)
   - Shows distribution and outliers across genders
   - Key insight: All genders cluster around 6 hours; females show more outliers

2. Scatterplot - Screen Time vs Sleep Duration (Altair)
   - Color-encoded by sleep quality (Viridis scale)
   - Key insight: Lower sleep quality clusters with higher screen time

3. Grouped Bar Chart - Depression by Social Media & Location (D3)
   - Interactive chart with error bars showing standard deviation
   - Key insight: Depression scores rise with social media usage; urban shows steepest increases

4. Heatmap - Screen Time vs Mental Health Distribution (Altair)
   - Shows density patterns across binned ranges
   - Key insight: Highest concentration in 4-8 hour range with moderate mental health scores

5. Grouped Bar Chart - Mental Health by Location & Gender (D3)
   - Interactive gender filter
   - Key insight: Mental health scores stable (49-51) across all combinations

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- Colorblind-friendly: Okabe-Ito palette, pattern overlays for D3 charts
- Interactivity: Tooltips and filters on D3 visualizations
- Accessibility: Clear labels, adequate contrast, descriptive axis titles
- Consistency: Left-aligned charts, consistent container styling
- Narrative flow: Visualizations ordered from general to specific

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
- Altair: Generated as PNG images, embedded as static images
- D3: Interactive JavaScript files loading data via d3.csv()
- Dependencies: D3.js v7, Vega-Lite v5, Vega-Embed v6 (CDN); Python: altair, pandas, vl-convert-python

KEY FINDINGS
- Screen time similar across genders
- Social media usage stronger predictor of depression than general screen time
- Sleep quality more affected than duration by screen time
- Urban environments amplify social media's negative mental health impacts
- Most participants fall into moderate ranges for both screen time and mental health
