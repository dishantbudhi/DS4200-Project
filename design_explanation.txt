================================================================================
VISUALIZATION 1: BAR CHART - Screen Time by Age Group and Gender (Altair)
================================================================================

Design Rationale:
This grouped bar chart provides a clear comparison of average daily screen time 
across age groups and gender categories. The visualization uses a column facet 
to separate gender categories, making it easy to compare patterns within and 
across groups.

Visual Design Choices:
- Color Scheme: Used distinct colors (#4a90e2 for Male, #e24a90 for Female, 
  #90e24a for Other) to clearly differentiate gender categories
- Layout: Column faceting allows side-by-side comparison of gender patterns 
  while maintaining readability
- Age Group Ordering: Ordered age groups logically from youngest to oldest to 
  show progression patterns
- Tooltips: Interactive tooltips show exact values on hover for precise 
  information access

Interaction Design:
- Tooltips: Hover over bars to see exact average screen time values
- Legend: Color-coded legend helps identify gender categories

Takeaway:
The visualization reveals that younger age groups (13-17, 18-25) consistently 
show higher screen time across all gender categories, suggesting that 
interventions may be most needed for younger demographics.

================================================================================
VISUALIZATION 2: BAR CHART - Distribution of Screen Time by Device Type (Altair)
================================================================================

Design Rationale:
A bar chart effectively shows the distribution of total screen time across 
different device types. Bars are sorted by value (descending) to make 
comparisons easy and clear. This avoids the overlapping issues that can occur 
with pie charts and provides precise value comparisons.

Visual Design Choices:
- Color Palette: Used a gradient-inspired color scheme (#667eea, #764ba2, 
  #f093fb, #4facfe) that is visually appealing and distinct
- Sorting: Bars are sorted by total hours (descending) for easy comparison
- Spacing: Appropriate padding between bars prevents visual clutter
- Value Encoding: Bar height directly represents total screen time hours
- No Overlapping: Clear spacing ensures all elements are visible

Interaction Design:
- Tooltips: Hover over bars to see exact total hours and percentages
- Color-coded bars match legend for easy identification

Takeaway:
The bar chart clearly shows that phones and laptops dominate screen time, 
with phones being the largest contributor. This is significant because phone 
usage is often associated with social media consumption, which research suggests 
has stronger links to mental health outcomes.

================================================================================
VISUALIZATION 3: SCATTER PLOT - Depression Score vs. Social Media Usage (D3)
================================================================================

Design Rationale:
A scatter plot is ideal for exploring the relationship between two continuous 
variables. This visualization allows users to see individual data points and 
identify patterns, clusters, and potential correlations.

Visual Design Choices:
- Color Encoding: Points are colored by location type (Urban, Suburban, Rural) 
  to reveal geographic patterns
- Point Size: Small, semi-transparent points prevent overplotting while 
  showing density
- Axes: Clear axis labels and appropriate scaling ensure accurate 
  interpretation
- Legend: Color-coded legend positioned outside plot area to avoid overlap
- Margins: Increased right margin to accommodate legend without overlapping 
  data points

Interaction Design:
- Tooltips: Hover over points to see detailed information including location, 
  gender, age, social media hours, depression score, and total screen time
- Location Filter: Dropdown menu allows filtering by location type to examine 
  patterns within specific contexts
- Brushing: Click and drag to select a region and filter points within that 
  range
- Point Highlighting: Points enlarge and become opaque on hover for better 
  visibility

Takeaway:
The scatter plot reveals whether there's a correlation between social media 
usage and depression scores. Users can explore how this relationship varies by 
location type and identify potential outliers or clusters in the data.

================================================================================
VISUALIZATION 4: HEATMAP - Screen Time vs Mental Health Score (Altair)
================================================================================

Design Rationale:
A heatmap comparing two key variables (daily screen time and mental health 
score) shows the distribution of people across different combinations. This 
simplified approach focuses on the core relationship of interest and avoids 
visual complexity while providing clear insights.

Visual Design Choices:
- Two-Variable Comparison: Focuses on screen time (binned into ranges) vs 
  mental health score (binned into ranges)
- Color Scale: Sequential blue scale where darker shades indicate more people 
  in that category
- Binning: Screen time binned into 0-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, 10+ hours; Mental 
  health binned into 0-30, 30-50, 50-70, 70-100
- Clear Labels: Both axes clearly labeled with bin ranges
- No Overlapping: Grid structure ensures no overlapping elements

Interaction Design:
- Tooltips: Hover over cells to see exact counts for each combination
- Color Legend: Shows the scale for interpreting cell darkness

Takeaway:
The heatmap reveals patterns in how screen time ranges relate to mental health 
score ranges. Darker cells show where most people fall, helping identify 
whether higher screen time correlates with lower mental health scores or if 
there are specific ranges that show better outcomes.

================================================================================
VISUALIZATION 5: GROUPED BAR CHART - Mental Health Scores by Location and Gender (D3)
================================================================================

Design Rationale:
A grouped bar chart effectively compares mental health scores across location 
types while showing gender breakdowns within each location. This allows users 
to see both main effects (location) and interaction effects (location × gender).

Visual Design Choices:
- Grouped Bars: Bars are grouped by location with gender subcategories, 
  allowing comparison of both dimensions
- Color Encoding: Gender categories use distinct colors consistent with 
  Visualization 1
- Value Labels: Numeric labels positioned above bars (or inside if bar is 
  short) show exact average scores without overlapping
- Spacing: Appropriate padding between groups and within groups ensures 
  clarity and prevents overlap
- Legend: Positioned outside plot area (right side) to avoid overlapping with 
  bars
- Margins: Increased margins to accommodate legend and ensure no element 
  overlap

Interaction Design:
- Gender Filter: Dropdown allows filtering to show only specific gender 
  categories
- Sort Options: Users can sort by location (default) or by mental health score 
  to identify highest/lowest scoring groups
- Tooltips: Hover over bars to see detailed information
- Bar Highlighting: Bars highlight on hover with increased opacity and border

Takeaway:
The visualization reveals how location context and gender interact to 
influence mental health scores. Some location-gender combinations may show 
distinct patterns, indicating that environmental context matters differently for 
different demographic groups.
